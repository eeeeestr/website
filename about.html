            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>hi! i'm bubbles. i hate writing about me pages, but i love reading them, so i'll put some effort. i started messing around with computers since i have memory. the first time i got into linux i was 11 years old i think, and i remember managing to install arch linux <a href="https://youtu.be/GKdPSGb9f5s">with this tutorial</a>. ever since i've been a slave of the penguin.</p>
            <p>despite that, i still have no idea how to code or properly write a shellscript. i have tried programming and scripting but all the syntax and logic components just don't stick in my head, i bet it's due to lack of practice, though.</p>
            <p>i was talking with coworker during some free time we had at work, and they asked me if i had any passion projects. anything that got me going "damn, i wanna get home and do this!". and i awkwardly smiled and said that i don't think i do. that's how this website began. i've tried making multiple websites in the past. <a href="https://tilde.green/~eeeeestr">this one is still active as time of writing this,</a> but i lost my ssh key and cannot access my account now (whoops).</p>
            <p>some of the things that interest me include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="left">anything <strong>public transit related</strong>. schedules, history, different agencies...</li>
                    <li class="left"><strong>trains</strong>, because they go choo-choo.</li>
                    <li class="left"><strong>maps!</strong> of course i like maps. old and new, historical and fictional.</li>
                    <li class="left">i "recently" discovered my love for <strong>musicals</strong> as well! (thanks to <a href="wife.html">my wife</a>, i must add). i haven't watched very many though.</li>
                    <li class="left">despite the fact that i'm terrible at making it, i actually like <strong>music</strong> (duh). i've always wanted to give music production a go, but every time i've ended up downloading fl studio, i just stare at the interface and quit the program because that ui is just way too scary for someone without any technical knowledge of music.</li>
                    <li class="left"><a href="plushies.html">plushies.</a> i bet you could probably guess that one.</li>
                    <li class="left">for some reason i've always like the topic of <strong>comparative religion</strong>.</li>
                    <li class="left">and, in general, <strong>sociology</strong>, learning about cultures, countries, flags, and all that.</li>
                    <li class="left"><strong>linux stuff</strong>, free software, libre stuff.</li>
                    <li class="left">gay shit.</li>
                    <li class="left"><a href="ouppy.html">ouppy</a>.</li>
